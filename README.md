# DataInf: Efficiently Estimating Data Influence in LoRA-tuned LLMs and Diffusion Models

We provide a codebase for "[DataInf: Efficiently Estimating Data Influence in LoRA-tuned LLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00902)" accepted at ICLR 2024. DataInf is an efficient influence approximation method that is practical for large-scale generative AI models such as LLMs or stable diffusion models. DataInf leverages an easy-to-compute closed-form expression, outperforming existing influence computation algorithms in terms of computational and memory efficiency.

## Quick start 

###Â Setup Environment
```
conda create -n datainf python=3.10
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### (Task 1) Mislabeled data detection

An easy-to-start Jupyter notebook `notebokes/Mislabeled_Data_Detection-RoBERTa-MRPC.ipynb` demonstrates how to compute the influence function values and how to detect mislabeled data points using the computed influence function values. 
 - We use the RoBERTa-large model and [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to significantly reduce the total number of parameters. 
 - We consider a noisy version of the GLUE-MRPC dataset; We synthetically generate mislabeled data points by flipping the label of data points. We randomly selected 20% of data points. 

### (Task 2) Influential data identification 
A Jupyter notebook `notebokes/Influential_Data_Identification-Llama2-Math-Reason.ipynb` demonstrates how to efficiently compute the influence function values, showing its applications to identify most influential data points. We use the [llama2-13b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf). It has thw following steps.

- **Step 1** Dataset generation: generate the `math_problem (with reasoning)` dataset with the following bash command. It will be stored at the `datasets` folder. 
```
python3 src/generate_sentence-math_datasets.py
```
It will generate the `sentence_transformation` and math_problem (withour reasoning) datasets as well.

- **Step 2** Fine-tune a model: fine-tune a llama-2-13b-chat model on the `math problem (with reasoning)` dataset. We use `src/sft_trainer.py`, which is built on HuggingFace's [SFTTrainer](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/scripts/sft.py). A sample CLI is given as follows.
```
python /YOUR-DATAINF-PATH/DataInf/src/sft_trainer.py \
    --model_name /YOUR-LLAMA-PATH/llama/models_hf/llama-2-13b-chat \
    --dataset_name /YOUR-DATAINF-PATH/DataInf/datasets/math_with_reason_train.hf \
    --output_dir /YOUR-DATAINF-PATH/DataInf/models/math_with_reason_13bf \
    --dataset_text_field text \
    --load_in_8bit \
    --use_peft
```

- **Step 3** Compute the gradients and influence function values.


## The core python file 

- `dataloader.py` includes the construction of tokenizers and generates noisy datasets.

- `lora_model.py` includes LoRA modules.

- `influence.py` includes influence computation algorithms.

- `generate_sentence-math_datasets.py` generates the sentence_transformation and the math problem datasets.


## CLI tool for mislabeled data detection tasks

We also provide a CLI tool. The following command will compute the influence function values of the GLUE-QNLI dataset. It uses the RoBERTa-large model and the LoRA rank is set to 8.

```
python3 launcher.py run --exp_id='config_qnli4' --run-id=0 --runpath='./'
```
